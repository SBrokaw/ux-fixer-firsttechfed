# FirstTechFed UX Fixer - Specifications Overview

## Project Description
A Firefox extension designed to restyle and fix the UX of firsttechfed.com, transforming it into a dense, efficient, text-based interface inspired by excellent CLI design principles.

- **Text-Based Interface**: Prioritize text over graphical elements
- **No Hidden Options**: Eliminate hamburger menus, dropdowns, and slide-in popups
- **Form Excellence**: Apply proven form design patterns for optimal user experience
- **Functionality Preservation**: Maintain all existing functionality while improving presentation
