# Task: Transfer Page Form Analysis
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 1-2 hours
Dependencies: Transfer page access, extension loaded, form reference files
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Analyze the transfer page forms to identify the specific UX issues mentioned by the user and validate that the extension correctly transforms problematic form elements. This focuses on the "particularly bad example" of forms that needs immediate attention.

## Steps
1. [ ] Review transfer page HTML from references folder
2. [ ] Identify all form elements and their current state
3. [ ] Document problematic dropdown menus and hidden options
4. [ ] Load extension and test on transfer page
5. [ ] Verify dropdown-to-radio conversions work correctly
6. [ ] Test form validation and submission
7. [ ] Document any remaining issues
8. [ ] Compare with reference HTML to ensure completeness
9. [ ] Test accessibility of transformed forms
10. [ ] Document specific improvements needed

## Data Collection
- Location: `data/validation/transfer-forms/`
- Format: Form analysis (MD), screenshots (PNG), test results (JSON)
- Validation: Verify all form elements are properly transformed and functional

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All dropdown menus converted to radio buttons or visible options
- [ ] No hidden form elements remain
- [ ] Form validation works correctly
- [ ] Form submission process is functional
- [ ] All form fields are accessible via keyboard

## Notes

- Test with different account types if applicable
- Document any JavaScript-dependent form behaviors
- Ensure form security is not compromised by transformations
