# Task: Extension Testing and Debugging
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 1-2 hours
Dependencies: Firefox browser, extension loaded, access to firsttechfed.com
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Test and debug the FirstTechFed UX Fixer extension to verify it applies the dense, CLI-inspired UI and preserves all functionality. The extension should transform the interface but appears to have no effect, and dropdown menus are actually worse with gaps and disappearing behavior.

## Technical Limitations Discovered
The FirstTechFed site uses a **modern Single Page Application (SPA)** with significant technical challenges:

1. **Dynamic Content Loading**: Navigation loads after page load with `data-primarynavigationinitcomplete=""`
2. **Complex Framework**: Uses Alkami's Iris framework with `iris-popover` components
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses `data-close-on-leave=""` and complex event handling
4. **Content Security Policy**: Likely has CSP restrictions blocking modifications
5. **Framework Interference**: Iris framework may override our styles

## Improvements Made
The extension has been updated with:

1. **Continuous Retransformation**: Checks every 2 seconds for 30 seconds for new content
2. **FirstTechFed-Specific Selectors**: Targets `iris-popover`, `nav-menu__popover`, etc.
3. **Framework Overrides**: Removes `data-close-on-leave` and other iris attributes
4. **Aggressive CSS**: Uses `!important` to override framework styles
5. **SPA Detection**: Monitors for navigation completion indicators

## Steps
1. [ ] Build the extension (`npm run build`)
2. [ ] Load the extension in Firefox
   - Go to `about:debugging`
   - Click "This Firefox"
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select the built extension from `web-ext-artifacts/firsttechfed_ux_fixer-1.0.0.zip`

3. [ ] Navigate to FirstTechFed website
   - Go to https://www.firsttechfed.com
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab

4. [ ] Check extension loading
   - Look for console messages starting with ðŸš€
   - Should see "FirstTechFed UX Fixer: EXTENSION LOADED AND RUNNING!"
   - Should see a blue "UX Fixer Active" indicator in top-right corner for 5 seconds

5. [ ] Check transformation process
   - Look for console messages starting with ðŸ”„
   - Should see "Starting transformations..." and element counts
   - Should see individual transformer completion messages

6. [ ] Check navigation debugging
   - Look for console messages starting with ðŸ§­
   - Should see "NavigationTransformer starting..."
   - Should see counts of navigation elements, hamburger menus, dropdown menus found
   - Should see "iris popovers found" and conversion messages

7. [ ] Check continuous retransformation
   - Look for "Navigation elements detected, applying transformations..." messages
   - Should see retransformation attempts every 2 seconds
   - Should see "Stopping continuous retransform" after 30 seconds or max attempts

8. [ ] Verify UI transformations
   - [ ] Dense layout is applied (minimal whitespace, compact UI)
   - [ ] Navigation is always visible (no hamburger/dropdown menus)
   - [ ] All dropdowns are replaced with radio buttons or inline options
   - [ ] Forms use CLI-inspired, text-based design
   - [ ] No hidden options or popups
   - [ ] All original functionality is preserved
   - [ ] Iris popovers are converted to inline display
   - [ ] Dropdowns no longer disappear on mouse movement
   - [ ] No gaps in dropdown menus

9. [ ] Test functionality
   - Navigate to the dashboard page
   - Navigate to the transfer page
   - Test keyboard navigation and accessibility (tab order, focus indicators)
   - Verify all site functionality is preserved

10. [ ] Document findings
    - Screenshot the console output
    - Note any error messages
    - Record what elements were found vs expected
    - Test if dropdowns still disappear or have gaps
    - Document any issues, unexpected behaviors, or visual bugs

## Data Collection
- Location: `tasks/human/validation/`
- Format: Screenshots, console logs, notes, bug reports
- Validation: Extension loads and shows debugging output

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] Console shows debugging messages
- [ ] Visual indicator appears briefly
- [ ] Transformation process runs
- [ ] Navigation elements are found and processed
- [ ] Iris popovers are converted to inline display
- [ ] Dropdowns no longer disappear on mouse movement
- [ ] No gaps in dropdown menus
- [ ] Dense, CLI-inspired UI is visible on dashboard and transfer pages
- [ ] All site functionality is preserved
- [ ] No critical console errors

## Expected Behavior
With the improvements, you should see:
1. **Immediate visual indicator** (blue box) for 5 seconds
2. **Console logging** showing element detection and transformation
3. **Continuous retransformation** messages every 2 seconds
4. **Iris popover conversion** messages
5. **Improved dropdown behavior** - no disappearing, no gaps

## Notes
**If the extension still doesn't work:**
1. **CSP Issues**: The site may have strict Content Security Policy blocking our modifications
2. **Framework Override**: The Iris framework may be too aggressive in overriding our changes
3. **Timing Issues**: Content may load even later than our 30-second window
4. **Event Conflicts**: Site's JavaScript may be fighting our transformations

**If extension loads but transformations fail:**
1. Check for CSP errors in console
2. Look for JavaScript errors from the site's framework
3. Note if elements are found but immediately reverted by site code

**Use Firefox Developer Edition for best results**
