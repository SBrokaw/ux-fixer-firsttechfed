# Task: Dashboard Baseline Testing
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 2-3 hours
Dependencies: Firefox browser, extension loaded, FirstTechFed login access
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Establish baseline measurements for the Dashboard page to validate that the extension produces expected transformations and maintains functionality. This is critical for ensuring the extension works correctly before proceeding with more complex transformations.

## Steps
1. [ ] Load extension in Firefox Developer Edition
2. [ ] Navigate to https://banking.firsttechfed.com/DashboardV2
3. [ ] Take screenshot of original page (before extension)
4. [ ] Enable extension and reload page
5. [ ] Take screenshot of transformed page (after extension)
6. [ ] Document all visible transformations
7. [ ] Test all interactive elements (buttons, links, forms)
8. [ ] Verify no broken functionality
9. [ ] Check browser console for errors
10. [ ] Measure page load time impact

## Data Collection
- Location: `data/validation/dashboard-baseline/`
- Format: Screenshots (PNG), console logs (TXT), performance data (JSON)
- Validation: Compare before/after screenshots, verify all functionality works

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Extension loads without console errors
- [ ] All navigation elements are visible (no hidden menus)
- [ ] All buttons and links are functional
- [ ] Page load time impact < 500ms
- [ ] No broken layouts or overlapping elements
- [ ] Dense layout is applied correctly
- [ ] Typography is improved and readable

## Notes
- Use Firefox Developer Tools for console monitoring
- Test on both desktop and mobile viewport sizes
- Pay special attention to any dropdown menus or hamburger menus
- Document any elements that don't transform as expected
- If login is required, note this as a dependency
